## Introduction

The goal of the DIF Schema Directory effort is to identify and catalog a suggested list of the most 
common semantic data types used across a wide array of application, service, and interaction contexts. 
It is the intent that contributors primarily seek to elevate awareness of data types from existing 
schema ontologies that are found to be in common usage based on community feedback and analysis of 
existing deployments. If an existing schema ontology or well-known deployment's data types does 
not exist that sufficiently serve an application, service, or interaction context participants 
are seeking to normalized, the DIF Schema Directory can serve as a home for new semantic data types.
