# Registry Instructions

1. Fill out template, defining as much as possible what will go into the registry. A starter document structure can be found in `single-file-test/spec.md`. This guide can be expanded and altered but folling the highlevel strucutre will make it easier for readrs to get up to speed with the profile. 
2. Contact the working group chairs for approval before accepting OUTSIDE registrations. Feel free to "prime the pump" with a few of your own before submitting for approval. 
4. Once approved, periodic checks and, if needed, editorial meetings should take place once a month or more. Contact chairs in case of hand-off of maintenance, or if outages of maintenance are foreseen.
5. Configure GitPages!
